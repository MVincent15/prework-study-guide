          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside fo an element</li>
          <li>A padding indicated how much space we want around the content inside an element</li>
          <li>Internal style sheet contains CSS rules for the webpage in teh head section of the HTML file</li>
          <li>External CSS style sheets allow developers to keep all their CSS rules in a seperate file, making changes easier</li>
          <li>A selector defines the element or attributes to which the rules or declarations will apply</li>
          <li>Declarations contain the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property</li>
          <li>You can combine two selectors with a single (,) allowing declarations to affect both selectors</li>
          <li>When you use an external CSS, always remember to link to the HTML otherwise you will not see the changes</li>
          <li>Class attributes allows us to share a CSS rule to any elelmt we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector.</li>
          <li>The Class attribute can be assigned to the elemtn in HTML, enabling us to freely choose which elemtns will be assigned in the CSS</li>

        <ul>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new bracnh and switches to it</li>

          <li>git commit -m "your message here" descibes the changes you made</li>
          <li>git pull origin main- pulls in the base branch to your feature branch. Making sure its up to date</li>
          <li>git push origin feature/(name of feature) pushes the changes to the reomte repo</li>
          <li>Using git commands we can intiate a repo, add our code to the repo, and view different versions which are each stored in a unique commit</li>
          <li>Repo is a folder in which all files and thier version histories are stored</li>
          <li>A branch is a workspace in which you can make changes that won't affect the live site</li>
          <li>A pull request (PR) is a way to ask for changes made to a branch to be merged into another branch.</li>
          <li>A merge is after a pull request is approved the commit, it will be merged from one branch to another and tehn deployed on the live site</li>
          <li>Issues are how work is tracked using Git. Allowing users to report new tasks and fixes, as well as track progress</li>
          <li>Always remember to git pull to make sure that you have the latest version of the project on the local computer before you start</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer exectures code in a script</li>
          <li>Assignment operators = assigns specific data that we stored in our variable</li>
          <li>A string includes all of the topics, and all stings are surrounded byt ""</li>
          <li>Console.log adds a method to the file. This outputs a message to the web consile by adding an argument</li>
          <li>The if conditional statement, allows code only to be executed if the statement meets a condition or is true. If we want to provide more than one condition you can use else if</li>
          <li>Array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data, typcially used ot hold data that is related in some way</li>
          <li>To work with items inside an array we need to have the location and index</li>
          <li>A for loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over</li>
          <li>Commenting out code makes it inactive without deleting it, just incase you need it later.</li>
          <li>A fucntion is a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task. And do not automatically execute when the file is run</li>
          <li>When we declare a function in the JavaScript code we are creating a reusable block of code that perfroms a specfic task. We then need to call the fucntion in the code at the spot we want to execute</li>
